# Internet Freedom

[Net Neutrality][wikipedia] suffers a marketing problem: People don't understand what it is, are scared off by a big name, and so ignore it.

Let's make it clear that this is an issue that *takes away freedoms* and will *stifle innovation* which is ultimately bad for everyone. Let's fight for our *Internet Freedom*.
